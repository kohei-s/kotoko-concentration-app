#  KoToKo: Japanese concentration game app
This mobile application is originally developed as my Fullstack capstone project for [Java Development Bootcamp at neue fische](https://www.neuefische.de/en/bootcamp/java-development) 2023.

## 1. Concept 📱
New concentration game app aims to support learning Japanese for so called [third culture kids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid) growing up speaking a different language in kindergarten or school (👉 [references & sources in research](https://github.com/kohei-s/kotoko-concentration-app/wiki/References-&-Internet-Sources)). The name of the app *KoToKO (言と言)* is a neologism that could mean *Word & Word*. 
## 2. Problem 😦
- Difficulty of staying motivated to learn the Japanese language in non-Japanese speaking countries
- Frustration of not being properly understood in Japanese by their own families
## 3. Target group 🧒🏾🧒🏼🧒🏿🧒🏻🧒🏽
Children between 5-15 years old learning Japanese as (one of) their home language(s), as well as their parents who want to support the learning journey
